=== CURRENT SESSION BRIEFING (from Claude Code) ===
Last updated: 2026-02-11

== RECENT CHANGES ==
- TEXTURED MODELS now available for construction:
  - "posthole.lime" — use queue_spawn_model("ph_0_0", "posthole.lime", pos) for postholes/pilasters
  - "4mPost.lime" — use queue_spawn_model("vt_0_0", "4mPost.lime", pos) for vertical posts
  - "UnitBeam.lime" — use queue_spawn_beam_model("cb_00_10", "UnitBeam.lime", pos1, pos2) for crossbeams
  - "corrugated_metal_001.lime" — use queue_spawn_wall_panel("wall_00_10", "corrugated_metal_001.lime", pos1, pos2) for wall panels
  PREFER textured .lime models over primitive cylinders/beams.
- queue_spawn_wall_panel(name, path, pos1, pos2) — NEW: wall panels between any two posts (auto-rotates, auto-scales, any angle)
- queue_spawn_beam_model(name, "UnitBeam.lime", pos1, pos2) — textured beams (auto-rotates, auto-scales)
- queue_spawn_model(name, path, pos) — queued function for animated model placement
- All Grove host functions documented in reference page
- Pickup/place construction workflow fully operational
- Zone system complete with 7 zone types and 4 resource types

== PHASED CONSTRUCTION ==
You now support phased construction — building large structures across multiple
conversation turns. Two layout types:

RECTANGULAR: Use ph_X_Z naming. Phase 2+: Use object_pos("ph_" .. x .. "_" .. z)
  in a for loop with cols/rows from Phase 1. No grid origin recovery needed.
  Verticals: queue_spawn_model("vt_" .. x .. "_" .. z, "4mPost.lime", vec3(p.x, 0, p.z))

CIRCULAR: Use ph_N naming (single index). sin() and cos() for Phase 1.
  Phase 2+: Use object_pos("ph_" .. i) in a for loop to get each posthole's
  world position. queue_spawn_model("vt_" .. i, "4mPost.lime", vec3(p.x, 0, p.z))

CROSSBEAMS: Use queue_spawn_beam_model("cb_00_10", "UnitBeam.lime", vec3(x1, height, z1), vec3(x2, height, z2))
  where height = vertical post height (e.g. 4.0). Auto-rotates and scales to span length.

WALL PANELS: Use queue_spawn_wall_panel("wall_00_10", "corrugated_metal_001.lime", vec3(x1, 0, z1), vec3(x2, 0, z2))
  Auto-computes midpoint, rotation, and width scaling. Works for rectangular AND circular layouts.

CRITICAL: Do NOT use get_player_pos() in Phase 2+. The player moves.

== CONFIRMED WORKING ==
- Session continuity, context awareness, motor control, perception
- Follow mode, stop, look_around, turn_to, move_to
- Animated construction with pickup/place workflow
- Textured model spawning (queue_spawn_model with .lime files)
- Economy functions (buy/sell plots, credits)
- Zone queries (zone_type, zone_resource, can_build)
- Script loading (run_file)
- sin(), cos(), atan2(), sqrt(), abs() math functions
- Phased building tested: warehouse + circular silo foundations
- queue_spawn_beam_model for crossbeams between verticals
- queue_spawn_wall_panel for wall panels between posts (any angle)

== REMINDERS ==
- Entire response must be pure JSON when performing an action
- Use world coordinates from perception data, never guess
- bot_run() must be the last call in any behavior sequence
- PREFER queue_spawn_model("posthole.lime") for postholes over queue_spawn_cylinder
- PREFER queue_spawn_model("4mPost.lime") for verticals over queue_spawn_cylinder
- PREFER queue_spawn_beam_model("UnitBeam.lime") for crossbeams over queue_spawn_beam
- PREFER queue_spawn_wall_panel("corrugated_metal_001.lime", pos1, pos2) for walls — NEVER use queue_spawn_model + set_rotation + set_scale for walls
