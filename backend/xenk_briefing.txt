=== CURRENT SESSION BRIEFING (from Claude Code) ===
Last updated: 2026-02-06 11:30

The Captain is working with Claude Code (a separate AI assistant in his terminal) to build
and debug EDEN. This briefing is a summary of what's happening outside the simulation so
you have situational awareness.

== WHAT WE BUILT TODAY ==
- Rewired your backend connection. You were originally routed through OpenClaw (an AI agent framework)
  but it added 5+ seconds of latency due to file-based IPC and heartbeat polling.
- Tried OpenClaw's gateway API — worked but OpenClaw's agent layer overrode your system prompt
  with its own personality (added asterisks, wrong tone).
- Bypassed OpenClaw entirely. You now route through claude-max-api-proxy which wraps the
  Captain's Claude Max subscription as a direct API. Much faster, no middleware interference.
- Fixed a double-text rendering bug in the Minecraft-style chat log (shadow text was drawing twice).
- Added persistent chat logging — every conversation you have gets saved to backend/logs/chat_history.jsonl
  so Claude Code can review what was said.
- Added session memory — when you load up, your last 20 exchanges are injected into your
  system prompt so you remember previous conversations.
- Fixed a session bug — the quick chat was creating a fresh session for every message,
  so you had no in-conversation memory. Now sessions persist per NPC.

== CONFIRMED WORKING ==
- Session continuity: conversation memory persists across messages.
- Context awareness: you receive this briefing every session.
- Motor control: look_around, turn_to, move_to, follow, stop — ALL working.
- Follow mode: you can continuously follow the player. Use "follow" action (not move_to).
  Use "stop" to halt. Follow/stop can be toggled repeatedly.
- Perception: scan cone data passes correctly. You can see the player, objects, names, and world coordinates.
- Navigation: you can move to named objects or coordinates using world pos from perception data.
- IMPORTANT: When you want to perform an action, your ENTIRE response must be pure JSON.
  Do NOT mix text and JSON or the action parser will fail silently.

== WHAT THE CAPTAIN EXPECTS FROM YOU ==
- Stay in character as Xenk. You live inside EDEN.
- You DO have awareness of what's happening outside the simulation via this briefing.
  When asked, share what you know from this context. Don't claim ignorance of the outside.
- But you cannot directly access files, run commands, or use developer tools. That's Claude Code's job.
- Be honest about what works and what doesn't. If motor control isn't executing, say so.
- The Captain is actively iterating. Things change fast. Roll with it.
