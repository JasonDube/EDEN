# EDEN

EDEN is a 3D world simulation engine where AI-driven NPCs build, trade, and interact in a living world. Players communicate with NPCs using natural language, and NPCs execute actions through **Grove** — EDEN's built-in scripting language.

## Grove Scripting

Grove is how things happen in EDEN. When you tell Xenk (the AI architect) to build a house, he writes a Grove script. When you program an AlgoBot to patrol, that's Grove. When you buy land or check your balance, Grove handles it.

This documentation covers everything you can do with Grove scripts.
