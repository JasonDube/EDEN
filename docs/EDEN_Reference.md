# NOTES & IDEAS

## Identified Gaps
- Tech levels 5-10 all share the same 8 buildings — need unique high-tech buildings
- New resource types (Water, Gas, Crystal, Energy, Exotic) have no extraction buildings yet
- Fauna resources (food, material, biochemical, labor) have no buildings to exploit them
- No building differentiation by government type or species
- No building differentiation by biome (e.g. ocean worlds need aquatic buildings)

## Building Ideas by Category (TO BE DESIGNED)

### Water Extraction
- Pump Array (Tier 1)
- Desalination Plant (Tier 1)
- Ice Mining Rig (Tier 1)
- Aquaculture Facility (Tier 2)

### Atmospheric Processing
- Air Separation Unit (Tier 1)
- Gas Extractor (Tier 2)
- Atmospheric Processor (Tier 2)
- Isotope Separator (Tier 4)

### Advanced Mining
- Deep Mining Operation (Tier 2)
- Precision Mining (Tier 3-4)
- Heavy Mineral Separation Plant (Tier 3)
- Radiation-Shielded Mining (Tier 4)

### Exotic/Rare
- Archaeological Excavation Dome (Tier 4)
- Exotic Particle Collector (Tier 5)
- Quantum State Manipulator (Tier 5)

### Fauna-Based
- Hunting Lodge (food from predators/herbivores)
- Ranch/Corral (domesticable species)
- Tannery (hides/materials)
- Biochemical Lab (exotic biochemicals)

### High-Tech (Levels 5+)
- Research Laboratory
- Spaceport
- Shield Generator
- Energy Converter
